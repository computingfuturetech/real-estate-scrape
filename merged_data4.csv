The neighbourhood is home to some of the most iconic skyscrapers offering panoramic views of the man-made Marina. Also, it is home to many commercial buildings, elite restaurants, cafes and famous shopping malls. Among its various record-breaking skyscrapers, Cayan Tower is a tall residential tower with a twist. With its unique structure and architectural design, not only it allows splendid views of Dubai Marina but is also a stunning addition to Dubai’s real estate market. Formerly known as Infinity Tower,  the helical structure was renamed to celebrate its uniqueness. Dubai Marina Cayan Tower took 8 years to complete. Upon its inauguration ceremony in 2013 by Cayan Investment and Development, 80% units were sold out even though interior fittings were in progress. The project has already been honoured by a number of awards including Arabian Property Awards, International Property Awards and Chicago Athenaeum. When launched, it was the world’s tallest tower with a twisted structure. Cayan Tower currently ranks as the 21st tallest building in Dubai.

For viewings please call our agent Inna Property details:714 sqft1 bedroom, 2 bathroomsParking spaceGym, swimming poolKids play areaConstruction began in 2006 and was completed by 2013. The building contains a mix of studios, one-, two-, three- and four-bedroomapartments as well as penthouses and duplexes. * Amenities include an outdoor infinity pool and whirlpool, a children’s play area, a fully equipped gymnasium, a world-class spa, massage rooms and a nursery. * The building is situated at the mouth of Dubai Marina thus enjoying great views of the marina, the sea and The Palm. * Cayan Tower is a helical skyscraper. The 73 floor plates are all identical but each is rotated by 1.2 degrees against the floor below it, resulting in a full 90-degree twist over the course of the tower's 307-metre rise, creating the shape of a helix. * Wind load and solar heat gain are reduced compared to a rectilinear building of the same height. * On completion, Cayan Tower was the world's tallest tower featuring a 90˚ twist. The shape of the tower is a variation on Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden, which also twists exactly 90˚. * The designers of this waterfront tower, Skidmore Owings and Merrill, are known for other world-renowned projects such as Burj Khalifa, Trump Tower in Chicago, and Jin Mao in Shanghai.

Building Details:3 bedroom3 washroom1645 sqft2.5M 4% DLD Charges2% + 5% Agency FeeNOC ChargesTitle deed ChargesTrustee Feeapartment rented till October 2024 evection notice served from sellerMarina Terrace is a 38-storey residential building in Dubai Marina, Dubai. The project was developed by Damac Properties. Construction began in 2003 and was completed by 2006. The architectural consultant was HOK Canada, Inc.  and the architectural consultant was Norr Group Consultants International Ltd. There are 33 residential floors above a five-storey podium. Marina Terrace was Damac’s first sortie into real estate construction, and when the building was launched in October 2002 the projected completion date was given as an improbable 2004. Not surprisingly the project was hit by delays, and although completed in 2005 the apartments were not handed over to residents until February 2006.  According to the Khaleej Times, Damac’s marketing tactics were probably the most aggressive in the business. For example, during Dubai Shopping Festival 2004 the company was giving away an Audi car with the purchase of apartments, and later a free Jaguar.
