The project was developed by Damac Properties. Construction began in 2003 and was completed by 2006. The architectural consultant was HOK Canada, Inc.  and the architectural consultant was Norr Group Consultants International Ltd. There are 33 residential floors above a five-storey podium. Marina Terrace was Damac’s first sortie into real estate construction, and when the building was launched in October 2002 the projected completion date was given as an improbable 2004. Not surprisingly the project was hit by delays, and although completed in 2005 the apartments were not handed over to residents until February 2006.  According to the Khaleej Times, Damac’s marketing tactics were probably the most aggressive in the business. For example, during Dubai Shopping Festival 2004 the company was giving away an Audi car with the purchase of apartments, and later a free Jaguar.
